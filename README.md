Visualizing Disparities in Life Expectancy

Life expectancy at birth is a metric that gauges the anticipated average lifespan of an individual, considering factors such as gender, birth year, and country of origin. Variations in life expectancy at birth can be attributed to a multitude of reasons, including advancements in medical care, the level of development in different nations, and the impact of armed conflicts. Furthermore, there is a noticeable gender disparity in life expectancy, with statistics indicating that women tend to outlive men. This phenomenon can be attributed to a range of potential factors, including biological factors and the hypothesis that women tend to exhibit greater health consciousness.
